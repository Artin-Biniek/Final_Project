For each feature file:
{
<Scenario>:""
<Given>:""
<When>:""
<And>:""
<Then>:""
}
Note:May change depending on what the feature file comes with(As shown with other files)

For each record file:
{
<Scenario>:""
<Given>:""
<When>:""
<And>:""
<Then>:""
}
Note:May change depending on what the feature file comes with(As shown with other files)

Reasoning:This uses the formatting as shown in the datasets for codet5p,utilizes tagging,and has the potential of processing data easier.
